** Dev should be able to enter options and args in any order (unlike with rbt)
    -[ ] Functional tests pass
    -[ ] Code has unit tests
    -[ ] Classes and public methods have doc strings

*** Dev passes arguments and gets appropriate response
    We always require 1 argument - an action. Most of the time we also
    require a change list number, though it's optional if the action
    is create. The user may pass who knows what, including multiple
    actions, changelists, their password, who knows?  The program
    should handle all that gracefully.

**** TODO No arguments
     If a user passes no arguments, print a short, useful message
     which includes reference to --help.

**** Action, but no changelist
     This is only valid if the action is create.

**** Changelist but no action

**** Multiple actions

**** Multiple changelists

**** Any extra junk they may decide to type in


** If dev enters unrecognized or bad input, print useful message
