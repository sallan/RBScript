* Sprint
** Code cleanup and refactor
** Dev can submit the review and it will block if no ship its or Review Bot its only
** Dev can submit even without ship its using the --force option
     
* Product Backlog
** Dev should be able to shelve a change when creating or editing a review
*** Use cases
**** New review without --publish option
     In this case, create the shelve and add a comment to the review about the shelve
**** New review with the --publish option
     Here we need to not pass --publish (already tested). We create
     the shelve and the new review, then we add the shelve comment,
     then we need to publish the review.
**** Update review with --shelve option
     Same idea as the 2 above.
**** Update review without --shelve option
     This is a new case. I think we should be able to auto-detect a
     shelved change and automatically update the shelve for the
     user. There is no good reason I can think of for having a review
     with a shelve that is out of date.
** Dev should be able to submit a review with a shelve
** Dev should be able to have review automatically open in browser

** The developer should not have to use the --shelve option if the CL has already been shelved.
    

* Done
** DONE Dev should be able to enter options and args in any order (unlike with rbt)
    We always require 1 argument - an action. Most of the time we also
    require a change list number, though it's optional if the action
    is create. The user may pass who knows what, including multiple
    actions, changelists, their password, who knows?  The program
    should handle all that gracefully.

*** DONE No arguments
     If a user passes no arguments, print help and exit.

*** DONE Action, but no changelist
     This is only valid if the action is create.

*** DONE Changelist but no action

*** DONE Multiple actions

*** DONE Multiple changelists

*** DONE Any extra junk they may decide to type in

** DONE If dev enters unrecognized or bad input, print useful message
** DONE Allow dev to create a new review from default change list
** DONE Jobs in CL should be automatically entered in RB Bugs field
** DONE User config file needs to be honored
   Right now you're hard-coding the url. Take that out and watch your
   tests fail, then...
** DONE Write unit tests for user config processing

** DONE [[Have%20automated%20functional%20tests][Automated Functional Tests]]
*** DONE Script to create new p4 repo
*** DONE Script to create new RB instance
**** DONE Create new site with admin account
    - Stop web service and delete old instance
    - Create new instance with admin account set up
    - Start web service 
**** DONE Be able to create 2 user accounts without admin rights in automated fashion
     This is not supported by the api. I'll work around it by creating
     an account for sallan as admin during installation.  That will
     allow me to test most use cases.
**** DONE Add perforce repo to new RB site
**** DONE Create p4 client for testing - template would be easiest way
**** DONE Be able to create a new review and verify it's content
*** DONE Basic functional test
    - create rr 1 with 1 bug and a branch, assign and publish
    - update rr 1
    - create rr 2 with branch, assign and publish
    - submit rr 2 with -f
    - submit rr 1 with -f

    I was going to verify the cl was updated, but that proved
    difficult and visual inspection was sufficient. Besides,I don't
    want to spend a lot of time testing rbt functionality.
