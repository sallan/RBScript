** DONE Dev should be able to post a review from the mergeit account

   Okay, the stuff below is the running dialog.  Here's what I decided
   to do: Whenever the --username is used, have post delete the
   .rbtools-cookies file.

   I decided to use --username instead of --submit-as because that's
   what people are used to using with post-review.

*** Whiteboard:
   
   For this, we need to handle the --username option.

   This works pretty much out of the box.  A few oddities:

   - Even if you have a valid cookie, you will always be prompted when you use --username
   - If you have a valid cookie, you can provide anything for a password and it will work

   That last item is a bug which you need to file with rbtools.  But to
   the extent that you properly pass username to rbt, this is done.

   On second thought, this needs more baking. In particular, I want to
   test out the --submit-as option more thoroughly.  Try this

   - [X] Create new linux user mergeit with no RB account
   - [X] Try posting from there as sallan with the --submit-as option
   - [X] Create new user buffy with an RB account
   - [X] Have buffy try posting as uid mergeit WITHOUT the --submit-as option.
   - [X] Have buffy try posting as uid mergeit with the --submit-as option.

    Depending on the results of those tests, we may want to consider
    some alternatives, such as

     - Create a mergeit account in RB
     - Write a wrapper script for post merges as mergeit that handles
       the authentication. Maybe review the old post-merge-review
       script.

** DONE Dev should be able to create or edit a review from submitted CL or range of CLs
*** DONE Create new review with range
*** DONE Edit existing review with range
*** DONE Create review with single file and rev range    
*** DONE Close review without submitting any CL
    This is essentially providing support for use of -rid when submitting.
** TODO Dev should be able to just print diff and not create/edit review

* Bugs we can use for testing
  - 456856 :: The post script needs to be compatible with RBTools 0.6
  - 475344 :: ReviewBoard does not properly show "p4 move"

* Product Backlog
** Test with RBTools 0.5.2 and 0.8
** Update confluence page
** Support the coverity tool
** Support the new --depends-on option in rbt
** Dev should be able to have review automatically open in browser

** The developer should be able to 'submit' a review that was never published

   Though a corner case, the developer should not see this ugly output
   if they try to do a submit on a rr they never published:

   % ./p2.py submit 819
   CRITICAL:root:HTTP 500
   CRITICAL: HTTP 500
   
   % p4 opened
   p4 opened
   File(s) not opened on this client.

   It's coming from rbt itself:

** Working via the rid
*** Dev submits a review with a different CL using rid and we update the CL in RB
    We should really just do this on all review even though RB does
    it for the standard use cases. The reason is because our update
    will be immediate and won't require special case code for this.

    This may not be so easy to do. I may have to leave this one in the
    hands of the RBTools folks.

    Update - I'm still unable to figure out how to do this.  I've
    filed a bug: Issue 3855
    

* Done
** DONE Port all code to python 2.6 and be able to demonstrate
** DONE Test previous failed case on production server
   When you tested a post to dory with some old config file changes,
   the .gnus file caused an exception. Try that again to verify the
   problem and then try it with RBTools 7. It'd also be nice to know
   why it's failing, though if it goes away with rbt7, I may have to
   let it go.

   I've reproduced this on rb2.0.15 with rbtools 0.7.  Need to file a
   bug report.  Also need to see if the old post/rb2 has the same
   problem. If so, I can punt it.

   - RBTools 0.5, RB 1.7 :: good
   - RBTools 0.6.3 RB 1.7 :: good
   - RBTools 0.7.1  RB 1.7 :: bad
   - RBtools 0.7.2  RB 1.7 :: bad


   So, now you're going to have to consider pairing up RB 2.0 with
   RBTools 0.6.3 until this bug is fixed.  

   I've tested RBTools 0.6.3 successfully against 1.7.28 and
   2.0.15. We should plan to roll out the new rbt with RBTools 0.6.3
   while 1.7.28 is still in service. Then we can concentrate on 2.0
   updgrade issues.


** DONE Dev should be able to post to an existing review using rid with a different CL
   One bit of complication here is that rbt does not update the CL in
   the review with a new CL number.  So, if someone tries to do a
   submit using the new CL, that will fail.  They'll need to use the
   rid and the CL, but since that's how they're creating it, it's not
   too weird.

   Ah, but the other problem is when you use the --publish option.
   How does rbt handle that?  Handles it fine, because it uses the
   rid. You should too.


   Now, for the million dollar question - should you update the CL
   when you submit?  I think so.

*** DONE Email rbtools list about having rid option update cl in review
*** DONE Dev creates a new CL and posts it to an open review
    This works out of the box with p2 because we pass rid along.
*** DONE Dev creates a new CL and posts it to an open review with publish option
    This fails because we now have a CL mismatch and we're not using
    the rid for some reason.
*** DONE Dev creates a new CL and posts it to a closed review
    What does rbt do in this case? It doesn't allow it. It tells you
    to reopen it if you really want to do this.

** DONE Dev should be able to submit a review with a shelve

** DONE The developer should not have to use the --shelve option if the CL has already been shelved.     
** DONE Dev should be able to shelve a change when creating or editing a review
*** Use cases
**** DONE New review without --publish option
     In this case, create the shelve and add a comment to the review about the shelve
**** DONE New review with the --publish option
     Here we need to not pass --publish (already tested). We create
     the shelve and the new review, then we add the shelve comment,
     then we need to publish the review.
**** DONE Update review with --shelve option
     Same idea as the 2 above.
**** DONE Update review without --shelve option
     This is a new case. I think we should be able to auto-detect a
     shelved change and automatically update the shelve for the
     user. There is no good reason I can think of for having a review
     with a shelve that is out of date.

** DONE Dev can submit even without ship its using the --force option
** DONE Dev can submit the review and it will block if no ship its or Review Bot ship its only
** DONE Dev should be able to enter options and args in any order (unlike with rbt)
    We always require 1 argument - an action. Most of the time we also
    require a change list number, though it's optional if the action
    is create. The user may pass who knows what, including multiple
    actions, changelists, their password, who knows?  The program
    should handle all that gracefully.

*** DONE No arguments
     If a user passes no arguments, print help and exit.

*** DONE Action, but no changelist
     This is only valid if the action is create.

*** DONE Changelist but no action

*** DONE Multiple actions

*** DONE Multiple changelists

*** DONE Any extra junk they may decide to type in

** DONE If dev enters unrecognized or bad input, print useful message
** DONE Allow dev to create a new review from default change list
** DONE Jobs in CL should be automatically entered in RB Bugs field
** DONE User config file needs to be honored
   Right now you're hard-coding the url. Take that out and watch your
   tests fail, then...
** DONE Write unit tests for user config processing

** DONE [[Have%20automated%20functional%20tests][Automated Functional Tests]]
*** DONE Script to create new p4 repo
*** DONE Script to create new RB instance
**** DONE Create new site with admin account
    - Stop web service and delete old instance
    - Create new instance with admin account set up
    - Start web service 
**** DONE Be able to create 2 user accounts without admin rights in automated fashion
     This is not supported by the api. I'll work around it by creating
     an account for sallan as admin during installation.  That will
     allow me to test most use cases.
**** DONE Add perforce repo to new RB site
**** DONE Create p4 client for testing - template would be easiest way
**** DONE Be able to create a new review and verify it's content
*** DONE Basic functional test
    - create rr 1 with 1 bug and a branch, assign and publish
    - update rr 1
    - create rr 2 with branch, assign and publish
    - submit rr 2 with -f
    - submit rr 1 with -f

    I was going to verify the cl was updated, but that proved
    difficult and visual inspection was sufficient. Besides,I don't
    want to spend a lot of time testing rbt functionality.

** DONE Code cleanup and refactor
